# 2014-Final-Project-Visual-Basic
This was the final project in my Programming, Logic, and Technique class.  It is a roulette wheel game.

This program was put together in my very first programming class.  Obviously, it is very, very simple and I think the teacher actually provided us with some of the code for the actual roulette wheel.  I tried to spice it up with a few simple pieces of ASCII art as well as a few pithy comments if the user tried to crash the program.
